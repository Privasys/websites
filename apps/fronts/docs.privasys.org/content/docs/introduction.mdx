Welcome to the Privasys technical documentation.

## The Problem

Cloud computing requires handing over your data to a third party. Even with encryption at rest and in transit, there is a fundamental gap: **data must be decrypted to be processed**. During that window, the cloud provider, the host OS, the hypervisor — or any privileged attacker — can observe it.

**Confidential Computing** closes this gap. Technologies like Intel SGX, Intel TDX, and AMD SEV-SNP keep data encrypted in hardware-protected memory, even while it is being processed. But hardware isolation alone is not enough — a remote client still needs proof that it is talking to a genuine, unmodified TEE. Traditional remote attestation solves this with custom protocols and specialised SDKs, which are incompatible with browsers and cumbersome to integrate.

## Our Approach

Privasys takes a different path. We embed attestation evidence **directly inside standard TLS certificates** — a technique called **RA-TLS** (Remote Attestation TLS). The result is a normal HTTPS connection that any client can use — a browser, `curl`, a mobile app — with no modifications. The hardware quote rides along inside an X.509 extension for any relying party that wants to verify it.

Our platform is **open source**, **confidential by design**, and **always verifiable**: anyone can inspect the code, attest the running enclave, and independently confirm that data is protected.

## Two TEE Models, Two Adoption Paths

Confidential computing hardware comes in two fundamentally different forms, each suited to different adoption scenarios. Rather than force a one-size-fits-all solution, Privasys provides a dedicated stack for each:

| | **Enclave OS Mini** (Intel SGX) | **Caddy RA-TLS Module** (Intel TDX / AMD SEV-SNP) |
|--|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **What it protects** | A single application inside a hardware enclave | An entire virtual machine with encrypted memory |
| **Trusted Computing Base** | ~4 MB enclave binary — minimal attack surface | Full Linux VM + Caddy — larger, but standard |
| **How you deploy** | Custom Rust build, SGX SDK, signed enclave | Standard Linux binary, xcaddy, no special SDK |
| **How apps run** | WASM modules loaded into the enclave | Any process in the VM; Caddy acts as reverse proxy |
| **RA-TLS certificate** | CA-signed, enclave-generated (intermediary CA sealed inside SGX) | CA-signed, TEE-generated (intermediary CA on filesystem) |

**Choose Enclave OS Mini** when you need the smallest possible attack surface and strong per-application isolation — ideal for security-critical workloads where minimising the Trusted Computing Base is paramount.

**Choose the Caddy RA-TLS Module** when you want to add attestation to existing applications with minimal changes — just place a Caddy reverse proxy inside a Confidential VM and configure the RA-TLS issuer.

Both paths produce standard RA-TLS certificates that can be verified by the same [RA-TLS client libraries](/ra-tls-clients). The choice of TEE backend is transparent to clients — they see a normal HTTPS connection either way.

## Platform Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Enclave OS Mini** | Lightweight SGX enclave runtime with RA-TLS HTTPS server, sealed KV store, and WASM app hosting. | Production |
| **RA-TLS for Caddy** | Caddy TLS issuance module that produces RA-TLS certificates for Confidential VMs (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP). | Production |
| **RA-TLS Clients** | Client libraries and CLI tools for verifying RA-TLS certificates and extracting SGX quotes. | Production |
