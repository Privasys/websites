Welcome to the Privasys technical documentation. Privasys is a confidential computing platform that lets you run workloads inside hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with standard HTTPS connectivity via RA-TLS.

## Platform Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Enclave OS Mini** | Lightweight SGX enclave runtime with RA-TLS HTTPS server, sealed KV store, and WASM app hosting. | Production |
| **Caddy RA-TLS Module** | Caddy TLS issuance module that produces RA-TLS certificates for Confidential VMs (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP). | Production |
| **RA-TLS Clients** | Client libraries and CLI tools for verifying RA-TLS certificates and extracting SGX quotes. | Production |
