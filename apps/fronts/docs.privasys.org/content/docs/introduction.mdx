Welcome to the Privasys technical documentation. Privasys is a confidential computing platform that lets you run workloads inside hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with standard HTTPS connectivity via RA-TLS.

## Two TEE Models, Two Adoption Paths

Confidential computing hardware comes in two fundamentally different forms, each with distinct trade-offs. Rather than force a one-size-fits-all solution, Privasys provides a dedicated solution for each:

| | **Enclave OS Mini** (SGX) | **Caddy RA-TLS Module** (TDX / SEV-SNP) |
|--|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation model** | Application enclave — only the enclave code is trusted | Confidential VM — the entire VM is hardware-encrypted |
| **TCB size** | ~4 MB enclave binary | Full Linux VM + Caddy |
| **Deployment** | Custom build, SGX SDK, signed enclave | Standard Linux binary, xcaddy, no special SDK |
| **Application model** | WASM modules loaded into the enclave | Any process in the VM, Caddy as reverse proxy |
| **RA-TLS certificate** | CA-signed, enclave-generated (intermediary CA sealed inside SGX) | CA-signed, TEE-generated (intermediary CA on filesystem) |

**Choose Enclave OS Mini** when you need the smallest possible Trusted Computing Base and strong per-application WASM isolation — ideal for greenfield, security-critical workloads on SGX hardware.

**Choose the Caddy RA-TLS Module** when you want to add attestation to existing applications with minimal changes — just configure a Caddy reverse proxy inside a Confidential VM running on Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP infrastructure.

Both paths produce standard RA-TLS certificates that can be verified by the same [RA-TLS client libraries](/ra-tls-clients), so the choice of TEE backend is transparent to relying parties.

## Platform Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Enclave OS Mini** | Lightweight SGX enclave runtime with RA-TLS HTTPS server, sealed KV store, and WASM app hosting. | Production |
| **RA-TLS for Caddy** | Caddy TLS issuance module that produces RA-TLS certificates for Confidential VMs (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP). | Production |
| **RA-TLS Clients** | Client libraries and CLI tools for verifying RA-TLS certificates and extracting SGX quotes. | Production |
