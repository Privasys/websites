// What the browser is doing right now, in the words the panel shows.

// Some work reports itself as it goes: an upload knows how many bytes it has
// sent. Other work is a single request the enclave answers only once it is
// finished. Deleting a folder is the second kind: one call, inside which the
// service walks the subtree and reclaims every file's sealed blobs. That is
// also the longest wait in the app, so the panel has to be able to say
// "this is running" without inventing a percentage for it.
